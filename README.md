# 🚀 Simple Web App – Patient EMR System

This project is a **Simple Web Application** for managing patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR). I developed this application with a **PostgreSQL backend** and deployed it on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using **Elastic Beanstalk** and **Amazon RDS**.

The project was designed to be:
- 💡 Highly **available**
- 📈 **Scalable**
- 🔐 **Secure**

> **Tech Stack**: AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, VPC), PostgreSQL, Python (or Node/Flask - update if needed)
